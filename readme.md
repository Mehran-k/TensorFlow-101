## Simple Introductory TensorFlow Examples

The aim of this GitHub repository is to provide a few simple TensorFlow examples to help learn TensorFlow faster.
More examples will be added in future.

* Example 1: Getting familiar with computation graph.
* Example 2: Getting familiar with variables and optimization.
* Example 3: Creating a simple logistic regression model to predict user genders based on their movie ratings.
* Example 4: Creating a simple convolutional neural network to classify MNIST images.
* Next example to be added: a simple embedding-based model to show how embeddings can be used in TensorFlow.
