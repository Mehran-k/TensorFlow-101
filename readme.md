## Simple Introductory TensorFlow Examples

The aim of this GitHub repository is to provide a few simple TensorFlow examples to help learn TensorFlow faster.
More examples will be added in future.

Next example to be added: a simple embedding-based model to show how embeddings can be used in TensorFlow.
